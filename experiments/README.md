# Experiments

We perform 2 sets of experiments:

1. **Toy Experiments:** Test neural multi-channel importance sampling on toy examples.
2. **Physics Experiments:** Test neural multi-channel importance sampling on comprehensive LHC example in a realistic Monte Carlo setup.

More details are given in each sub-folder.
