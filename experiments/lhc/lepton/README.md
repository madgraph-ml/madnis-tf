# Lepton collider

We start by considering the following simple process

$$
\mathrm{e}^{-} \mathrm{e}^{+}\to \mathrm{Z}/\gamma \to \mathrm{q} \bar{\mathrm{q}},
$$

and provide the corresponding full amplitude by a tensorflow function. This makes this integrand differentiable and allows for optimized training methods.
