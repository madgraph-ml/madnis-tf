# Drell-Yan

We start by considering the following simple process

$$
q \bar{q} \to \mathrm{Z}/\gamma \to \ell^{-} \ell^{+},
$$

where $q =\mathrm{u}, \mathrm{d}, \mathrm{c}, \mathrm{s}$.
We provide the corresponding full amplitude and weight by a tensorflow function. This makes this integrand differentiable and allows for optimized training methods.

## PDF implementation

In order to have differentiable PDFs we rely on the pdfflow implementation...

TODO: Note and explain needed packages... (LHAPD, pdfflow, etc)
